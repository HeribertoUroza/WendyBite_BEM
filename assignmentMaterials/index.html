                The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida.
                The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund
                (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin
                board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was
                subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the
                retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.
